## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Rob

## About Me:
I'm currently a PhD student at The University of Sheffield, working as part of the [Visual Computing Research Group](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/cs/research/groups/computer-vision). My research interests lie in Computer Graphics, mainly on the **physically-based animation** of deformable objects and fluids. I am currently working on multiphysics simulations of interactions between deformable objects and liquids.
